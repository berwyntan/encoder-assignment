# encoder-assignment

- Terminal will prompt user to enter "encode" or "decode" (not case sensitive)
- If neither is input, program will exit
- If encoding, the offset character will need to be input (not case sensitive), followed by the text to encode (case sensitive).
- If offset character is not valid, the program will still run without encoding the text.
- Decoding requires only the encoded text.
- If offset character (first character) is not valid, the program will still run without decoding the text.
